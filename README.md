# Notes
* For optimal game peformance you would ideally use mips, as of now, mips are not suported.
* to enable mipmaps you need to run the app with -UMM otherwise the app will default to no mipmapping

# TO DO:
Add Proper Mip-Mapping support(not sure what Mips are?, refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap)
