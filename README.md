# PS4-RE-TEX
PS4 RE texture creator.
# Requirements

orbis-image2gnf.exe

libSceTextureTool.dll

libSceGpuAddress.dll

libSceGnm.dll

# Usage:
Put all the requirements in the Data Folder, extract the mod with the textures, run app, wait for it to close, and you are done. if you want mipmapping boot the app with -mm for mip-mapping to be enabled;

# Notes
* For Optimal Peformance, Use the mipmaping option(i've included batch files that enable the mipmaping automaticlly just load them).

# TO DO:
~~Add proper Mip support(hopfully this will be in version 2.0) **Done** - Should be correctly working as of now~~ 

BROKEN AGAIN.. DO NOT USE.
